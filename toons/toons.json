        "description": "When I opened my eyes, I was inside a novel. [The Birth of a Hero].  [The Birth of a Hero] was a novel focused on the adventures of the main character, Choi Han \u2013 a high school boy from Earth who was transported to a different dimension \u2013 alongside other numerous, rising heroes of the continent. I became a part of that novel as the trash of the Count\u2019s family, the family that oversaw the territory where the first village that Choi Han visits is located.  Choi Han became vengeful after that village was destroyed by a mysterious group of assailants, and grew incensed after he reported the matter to the Count\u2019s son and got brushed off. He gets beaten to a pulp.  \u201c\u2026This is going to be a problem.\u201d  But, I feel like it is worth trying to make this my new life regardless.",
